This is an assignment for The Odin Project.

The goal is to build an 'Etch A Sketch' with a 16 x 16 grid, with the initial colour value being black when 'sketching.'

The Color button will make it so each grid square is filled in with a different random colour.

The Reset button resets the grid and prompts for input on grid size.

The Black button sets the colour for each square to be filled with black.
